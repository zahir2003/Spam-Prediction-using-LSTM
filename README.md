# 📧 Spam Detection using LSTM

Welcome to the **Spam Prediction using LSTM** project! This repository demonstrates a modern, end-to-end deep learning approach to classifying SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam) using an LSTM neural network. The project is designed to impress recruiters and visitors by showcasing best practices in data science, machine learning, and deep learning with Python.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Deep Learning Model:** Built with Keras & TensorFlow, leveraging an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network for sequential text classification.
- **Comprehensive Data Pipeline:** Includes data loading, preprocessing, visualization, tokenization, and padding.
- **Robust Evaluation:** Model performance is measured with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix visualizations.
- **Modern Tools:** Utilizes pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Jupyter Notebook Workflow:** All steps are clearly documented and visualized in an interactive notebook.
- **Production Ready:** Trained model is saved for future inference or deployment.

## 📊 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
	- Load SMS dataset with pandas
	- Explore class balance, missing values, and sample messages
2. **Visualization**
	- Visualize class distribution and message statistics with seaborn/matplotlib
3. **Preprocessing**
	- Encode labels, tokenize text, pad sequences
	- Train/test split for robust evaluation
4. **Model Building**
	- LSTM-based neural network with embedding layer
	- Compiled with Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss
5. **Training & Validation**
	- Track accuracy and loss over epochs
	- Early stopping and class weighting for best results
6. **Evaluation**
	- Accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
	- Visualize results for clear insights
7. **Model Saving**
	- Save trained model for future use
